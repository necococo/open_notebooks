    "\t- ユーザーのクエリに対して、「理想的な文書（仮想的な文書）」をまず生成 する\n",
    "\t- その仮想文書を埋め込み化し、それと類似した既存の文書を検索する\n",
    "\t- 結果として、より関連性の高い情報にたどり着きやすくなる\n",

    "3. なぜこの方法が有効なのか？\n",
    "\t- 従来のRAGでは、ユーザーのクエリが単純すぎると、適切な文書を見つけにくいことがある\n",
    "\t- HyDEは、まず「こういう情報がありそうだ」という仮想文書を作り、それを元に検索するため、より関連性の高い文書にアクセスしやすい\n",
    "\t- 特に、検索対象の文書が大量にある場合や、直接的なキーワード検索が難しい場合に有効\n",
